DevDock
=======

… is a template system for managing docker-compose container groups.

Its main purpose is to make docker-compose projects portable,
saving you from having to adjust lots of absolute paths manually.

It also helps you keep secrets like passwords in separate files
distinct from your structural blue print. That way, you can host the
latter in a public git repo while `.gitignore`-ing your secrets.





Installation
